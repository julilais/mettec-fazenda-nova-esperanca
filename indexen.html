        <h2 id="historia">History of cocoa</h2>
            
            <p>Cocoa has a rich history dating back to ancient civilizations in Central and South America. The Maya and Aztecs were among the first cultures to cultivate cocoa, using its seeds to prepare a bitter drink known as "xocoatl," which was often reserved for religious ceremonies and special occasions. With the arrival of European explorers, cocoa was taken to the Old World, where it quickly gained popularity, especially when sweetened with sugar.

                In Brazil, cocoa cultivation began in the 17th century, initially in the Amazon region, but it was in Bahia that the crop truly became established. From the 19th century onwards, cocoa production expanded significantly, making Brazil one of the world's leading producers. This expansion was driven by the cabruca system, an agricultural technique that preserves part of the native forest by integrating cocoa trees with existing vegetation, thus promoting ecological balance.</p>

            <h2>Types of cocoa in Brazil</h2>
        <p> The main types of cocoa cultivated are Forastero, Criollo, and Trinitario. Forastero is the most common, responsible for about 80% of world production, and is known for its resistance to pests and diseases, as well as being more productive. Criollo, although less common, is highly valued for its fine and complex flavor, being considered a high-quality cocoa. Finally, Trinitario is a hybrid of these two varieties, combining the robustness of Forastero with the sensory quality of Criollo, resulting in a versatile option appreciated by chocolatiers.  </p>

        <h2> What is Cabruca? </h2>

            <p id="textocabruca">Cabruca is a traditional agroforestry system used primarily for cocoa cultivation in the Atlantic Forest region of southern Bahia. This technique involves planting cocoa trees under the shade of native vegetation, preserving a large portion of the original forest. By maintaining forest cover, cabruca promotes biodiversity, creates a microclimate favorable to the development of cocoa trees, and helps conserve the region's water resources.

                In addition to its environmental benefits, cabruca also plays an important role in protecting local fauna, serving as a habitat for numerous species of birds, mammals, and insects. This sustainable practice helps mitigate the effects of climate change, as the remaining trees contribute to carbon capture.
                
                In an economic context, cabruca adds value to Brazilian cocoa, providing a differentiated product that attracts international markets interested in sustainable agricultural practices and high-quality products. Thus, cabruca not only promotes environmental preservation but also offers a viable alternative for small and medium-sized cocoa producers, strengthening the local economy and ensuring the continuity of this centuries-old tradition.

        <h2 id="Dia">Cocoa Day in the Chamber of Deputies: Debate on the importation of cocoa without regulation and without pest control.</h2>
        <p id="textonoti">On October 15th, cocoa producers from several Brazilian states, especially Bahia, Pará, and Espírito Santo, met in a session at the Chamber of Deputies to discuss the dangers of importing cocoa without pest control.
            The Agriculture, Livestock, Supply, and Rural Development Committee of the Chamber of Deputies held a public hearing on October 15th to discuss the direct risks caused by changes in the rules for importing cocoa beans.
            The objective was to discuss Normative Instruction 125/21, which revoked phytosanitary requirements for the import of cocoa beans from Ivory Coast. The rule eliminated the requirement for treatment with methyl bromide, a product used to control crop pests common in Africa.
            
            Domingos Sávio, the deputy who requested the session, as well as scholars on cocoa farming, warn that African pests can contaminate plantations in Brazil, even those of other crops. According to the congressman, the discussion on the subject is necessary to guarantee the sustainability and competitiveness of national cocoa farming.
            "It is essential to debate the direct consequences of Normative Instruction 125/21 on the sector, in order to ensure the protection of Brazilian production and the phytosanitary safety of cocoa crops," he states.

        <p>My name is Juliana Almeida, and I am the granddaughter of Agostinho Almeida. My entire family comes from the interior of Bahia, and all of them, except me, live in the city of Jequié, BA. The farm is located in the southwest/south region of the state and is our passion. Picking cocoa, papaya, cassava, cashew, tangerine, lemon, banana, and coconut are customary tasks when we go there.

            It is a joy to be able to enjoy this diverse and special space.</p>
